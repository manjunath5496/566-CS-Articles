<li>"Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren&rsquo;t doing anything.&nbsp; One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.&nbsp; Very often they&rsquo;re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space.&nbsp; What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head."<br /><em>&mdash; Charles M.</em>&nbsp;<em>Strauss<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</li>

<li>"If you have a procedure with ten parameters, you probably missed some."<br /><em>&mdash; Alan Perlis</em><br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>"How rare it is that maintaining someone else&rsquo;s code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building, which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating. More often, maintaining someone else&rsquo;s code is like being thrown headlong into a big pile of slimy, smelly garbage."<br /><em>&mdash; Bill Venners<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</li>
